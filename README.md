# Alphabet Soup: Analysis of Organizations Funded

## Background and Purpose:
Alphabet Soup is a company with philanthropy as its core value. It seeks to help organizations that focus on protecting the environment, improving well being, and unifying the world. Over two decades, Alphabet Soup has invested a combined $10 billion into life saving technologies and improving deforestation around the world. The purpose for this analysis is to see how the funding has impacted the organizations and further vet the recipients. This is a necessary analysis in order to ensure that the organization's money is effective. The company is aware of cases in which companies disappeared following reception of the funds. Due to this, the company wishes to create a prediction algorithm to better determine which companies are worth giving donations vs those that are too risky. 

Due to the complexity of the analysis being done, traditional analysis/machine learning have been set aside in favor of a deep learning neural network. It will evaluate all of the data collected by Alphabet Soup over the years to create and train a classification algorithm to predict companies worth giving funding based upon how effective companies with similar data were with the funding in the past. There are 6 questions the data and algorithm answer in the results section below.

## Results:
1) What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

2) What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

3) What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

4) How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

5) Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

6) What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary and Conclusion:
